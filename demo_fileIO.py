#How to use this file:
#step one: using https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Windows-x86_64.exe
#install python.
#step three: locate the dedicated python terminal in your start menu, called mambaforge prompt.
#within that prompt, give the following instructions:
#conda update --all
#conda install pip numpy scipy
#pip install tk numba pyroomacoustics pyfftw
#if all of these steps successfully complete, you're ready to go, otherwise fix things.
#run it by executing this command in the terminal, in the folder containing the file: python demo_fileIO.py

      #24000/256 = 93.75 hz per frequency bin.
      #the first bin is the zero bin- it is not estimated in the total bin frequency.
      #so, with 37 bins, the bandwidth is 36 * 93.75 or 3375.0 khz.
      #a 4000 hz window(the largest for SSB is roughly 43 bins.)
      #https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency
      #so we use 36 bins in total and catch most speech activity around 3400hz.
      #we could do a better job of achieving selectivity if we allocated more bins to frequency and less to time,
      #but all the other settings we could consider do not provide so general and easy a framework as 512 and 128.
      #resampling everything to 48000, or using hop/4 for 24000,12000,6000, and resampling to closest delivers nearly identical results.
      #given that 48000 is a standard used almost everywhere, this works out optimally.
